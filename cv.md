## About Me
Good day! My name is Vitaliy. I want to become a frontend developer. I watched YouTube videos and read articles. Everything was jumbled up in my head. Then I realized that I need to go to the courses. Thanks to my friends, I learned about RSSCHOOL, successfully signed up for stage0, and now I'm doing the first task. If you've read it, good luck! Let's start writing code!

## Code example

You were camping with your friends far away from home, but when it's time to go back, you realize that your fuel is running out and the nearest pump is 50 miles away! You know that on average, your car runs on about 25 miles per gallon. There are 2 gallons left.

Considering these factors, write a function that tells you if it is possible to get to the pump or not.

Function should return true if it is possible and false if not.

```
const zeroFuel = (distanceToPump, mpg, fuelLeft) => {
  // TODO
  let a = distanceToPump / mpg;
  if (a <= fuelLeft){
    return true;
  }
  return false;
};
```
